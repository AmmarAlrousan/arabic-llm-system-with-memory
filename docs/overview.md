# Project Overview

ASM (Arab Synthetic Mind) is a research-oriented prototype that explores
Arabic-focused Large Language Model (LLM) system design.

The project focuses on:
- modular prompt layering
- reasoning guidance
- memory persistence
- ethical and cultural value alignment

This repository is intended as a **system architecture prototype**, not a
finished product or published research paper.
