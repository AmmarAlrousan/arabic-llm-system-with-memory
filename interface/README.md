# Interface (Prototype)

This folder contains a minimal PyQt-based interface used to demonstrate the ASM system.

## Notes
- This interface is a **prototype**.
- It is not intended for production use.
- The focus of this project is the **LLM system architecture**, not UI design.

## How to run
```bash
python interface/gui_pyqt.py
```
Future work may include a web-based interface (e.g., Streamlit).
